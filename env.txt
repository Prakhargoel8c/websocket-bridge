# Configuration environment vars for Riva Websocket Bridge

# Replace the IP and port with your hosted Riva endpoint
RIVA_API_URL="localhost:50051"

# The port your Node.js app will be hosted at
# The peer-js server, to be used for negotiating the peer-to-peer chat connection,
# will be one port up from this. So if PORT="8009", then peer-js will be at 8010.
# The client does the same, so if e.g. your router forwards 58009 to 8009 for the app,
# then the client will look for peer-js at port 58010.
PORT="8009"
